## Manual Testing

I have manually tested this project by doing the following:

- Passed the code through a PEP8 linter and confirmed there are no problems
- Added code for input validation and exception handling: 
 - Users cannot input numbers or special characters instead of letters throughout the game, whilst giving their name, navigating the game options or quitting
 - In the game they can't guess more than one letter at once or a letter they have already guessed
- Tested in my local terminal on GitPod and in the Code Institute Heroku terminal
