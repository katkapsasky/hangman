# Hangman

Hangman is a Python terminal game which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users have to guess the secret word generated by the computer before the stick man is fully formed. Users can choose a level for easy, medium or hard words.

## How to Play

Originally, Hangman is a two-player pen and paper game where one player thinks of a word and the other player has to guess it by suggesting one letter at a time within a certain number of guesses. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).

In this version, the player chooses a difficulty level at the start of the game; easy, medium or hard, and the computer generates a random secret word from the chosen level for the user to guess, with dashes representing the letters of that word.

When a player guesses a letter correctly, it will show up as many times as it appears in the word. 
To win the game, players have to guess the secret word before the hangman is fully formed.

If a player guesses incorrectly, part of the hangman will be drawn. Players will have six wrong attempts to guess the word and on the seventh the hangman will be fully formed and the player loses.
